            <h2>Scripting addition</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>chunkwm</strong> offer advanced functionality that is achieved by injecting code into the Dock process.</br>
                This gives us elevated privileges, which allow for more control of other application's windows.
            </p>

            <p>Installing the scripting addition allows for the following functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ability to switch active desktop instantly, bypassing the animation (High Sierra and Mojave)</li>
                <li>ability to create and destroy desktops (High Sierra and Mojave)</li>
                <li>ability to move desktops (and its windows) to a different monitor (Mojave)</li>
                <li>option to lower the opacity of inactive windows, through smooth alpha fading</li>
                <li>make floating windows always stay on top</li>
                <li>tag a window as "sticky", making it appear on all desktops</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The scripting addition injects code into Dock.app, which is a system application. </br>
                Because of this you need to disable <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899">SIP</a> to install or uninstall this extension.</br>
                If you are running High Sierra or an earlier version, SIP can safely be reenabled after you have installed the scripting addition.
            </p>
            <p>
                To change the status of SIP, you need to reboot into recovery mode. On newer MBPs this can be done
                by restarting your mac and hold down "cmd + r" during boot, until you see a white progress bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once recovery mode has booted up, click the utilities menu in the menubar and open a Terminal.

                <pre><code>
                    # to disable SIP:
                    csrutil disable

                    # to enable SIP:
                    csrutil enable
                </code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                After you have disabled SIP, you can use the following commands to install / uninstall the scripting addition.
                <pre><code>
                    # to install scripting-addition
                    sudo chunkwm --install-sa

                    # to remove scripting-addition
                    sudo chunkwm --uninstall-sa
                </code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                When the scripting-addition has been installed, you can load it by running: <em>chunkwm --load-sa</em></br>
                <em>chunkwm</em> will automatically load the scripting addition at startup, or when the Dock is (re)launched.
            </p>

            <p>
                The scripting-addition is open source and can be found on my github: <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/chwm-sa">chunkwm-sa</a>
