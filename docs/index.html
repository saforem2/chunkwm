            <h4>Deprecation notice</h4>
            <p><strong>chunkwm is no longer in development because of a C99 re-write, <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">yabai</a></strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>yabai</strong> was originally supposed to be the first RC version of <strong>chunkwm</strong>.
            However due to major architectural changes, supported systems, and changes to functionality, it is being released separately. There are multiple reasons behind these changes, based on the experience I've gained through experimenting with, designing, and using both kwm and chunkwm. Some of these changes are performance related while other changes have been made to keep the user experience simple and more complete, attempts to achieve a seamless integration with the operating system (when possible), proper error reporting, and yet still keep the property of being customizable.</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p><strong>chunkwm</strong> is a tiling window manager for macOS that uses a plugin architecture, successor to <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm"><strong>kwm</strong></a>.
            It represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree, and supports binary space partitioned, monocle and floating desktops.</p>

            <p><strong>chunkwm</strong> is supported on macOS High Sierra (10.13.6) and Mojave (10.14.5). Older versions may or may not be compatible and is not officially supported.</p>

            <p><strong>chunkwm</strong> uses a pid-file stored as <em>/tmp/chunkwm_$USER-pid</em> to keep multiple instances from being launched by the same user.</p>

            <p><strong>chunkwm</strong> uses a unix domain socket stored as <em>/tmp/chunkwm_$USER-socket</em> to listen for runtime commands.</p>

            <p><strong>chunkc</strong> is a program that writes messages on <em>chunkwm&#39;s</em> socket.</p>

            <p><strong>chunkwm</strong> does not handle any keyboard input.</br>
            A third party program (e.g: <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd"><em>skhd</em></a>) is needed to map keyboard events to <em>chunkwm</em> actions.</p>

            <p>For instructions on how to install <strong>chunkwm</strong>, visit the <a href="./docs/userguide.html">user's guide</a>.</p>

            <p>If you later decide that you no longer want to use <strong>chunkwm</strong>, it can easily be removed without leaving any trace.
            The method of uninstalling differs depending on the installation method of your choice. Both <em>brew</em> and <em>macports</em> are trivial to use for this purpose.</p>

            <p>Both of my tiling window managers (<em>kwm</em> and <em>chunkwm</em>) have been heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a>,
            and I&#39;d like to thank <a href="https://github.com/baskerville">baskerville</a> for his project and for introducing me to an interesting tiling concept.</p>
