   previously set by *mouse_modifier*.

   to get the same behaviour as before this change, use: `chunkc set mouse_move_window \"fn 1\"`

 - *mouse_resize_window* is a new cvar that is used to set the binding to use to resize windows using the mouse.
   previously set by *mouse_modifier*.

   to get the same behaviour as before this change, use: `chunkc set mouse_resize_window \"fn 2\"`

 - *mouse_motion_interval* is a new cvar that is used to set the time between two motion events in milliseconds.

See updated README for the tiling plugin for more information.

 - *--use-insertion-point* command now applies to the current desktop, instead of the current node.

   fading inactive windows, properly restoring alpha values when deactivated.

 - *mouse_resize_window* has been extended to also allow resizing of floating windows.

 - *mouse_move_window* is now rate-limited by the *mouse_motion_interval* cvar
